# Product Recommendation Search Extension for Chrome

Users can search for a project and using some type of ranking algorithim, the best products from multiple sites will be shown with considerations for discounts from coupon providers like _Honey_. The extension will then, within itself, present a case for which product the user should buy for the user to then decide. 

## Need to have

- ranking algorithim that can identify top products
- deployed extension that works on multiple platforms (Amazon, Shopify, etc.)
- LLM-based pro, con list for each product
- Pleasent UI

## Nice to have

- Access to other extensions for information
- Fast run times
- Should be free, ideally.
- Cool animations for the pro-con list to make it engaging. Maybe like a Court Simulation (saw this at a Hackathon and it was pretty cool).
- The user can purchase from within the extension (need to figure out security).

# Adjusted Proposal

I talked to Mr. Schellenberg about switching my project to the doxxing machine earlier. This is the updated proposal, slighlty modified for the new project. However, the core concepts remain the same.

## Need to have

- searching algorithim that can identify websites for people
- deployed website that can perform searches of multiple people on multiple pages (i.e. not just limited to reading Facebook, it can look at Youtube, a company website, etc.)
- LLM-based analysis of each person
- Pleasent UI

## Nice to have

- Access to other extensions for information
- Fast run times
- Should be free, ideally.
- Cool presentation, not animations, for the project.
- The user can purchase from within the extension (need to figure out security). _(This is now irrelevant)_
