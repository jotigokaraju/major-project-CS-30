# Product Recommendation Search Extension for Chrome

Users can search for a project and using some type of ranking algorithim, the best products from multiple sites will be shown with considerations for discounts from coupon providers like _Honey_. The extension will then, within itself, present a case for which product the user should buy for the user to then decide. 

## Need to have

- ranking algorithim that can identify top products
- deployed extension that works on multiple platforms (Amazon, Shopify, etc.)
- LLM-based pro, con list for each product
- Pleasent UI

## Nice to have

- Access to other extensions for information
- Fast run times
- Should be free, ideally.
- Cool animations for the pro-con list to make it engaging. Maybe like a Court Simulation (saw this at a Hackathon and it was pretty cool).
- The user can purchase from within the extension (need to figure out security).
