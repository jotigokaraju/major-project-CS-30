# Beta Testing Document


## Computer Programmer

- UI needed
- There's a bug when it opens up a webpage that hasn't loaded completely and downloads it [FIXED]
- This only works on Chrome, it should be deployed to multiple platforms [CANNOT FIX]
- An alternate idea is to use the html rather than create a pdf [IT'S LESS EFFECTIVE FOR IMAGES]
- Deploy the website on a server, not locally [WORKING ON]

## Non-Programmer

- Show the info visually, I can't read the text
- What if someone doesn't have enough of an online prescense? [ADDED MULTIPLE LAYER SEARCH]
- It looks pretty cool
- You should add a safety feature for only people above 18 to be searched
