# Committs

Some Stuff was not Committed like Python Code that was done originally or Research Days. Below is a a digitized log book for these days that a commit message is missing from GitHub. 


## January 14

- Reading about AI implementation
- Reading about fixing a bug because Chromium did not let me use JS despite activating setting

## January 7-8

- Did not do much work on 7 we had test
- January 8 was spent mostly going through the huggingFace documentation, I forgot to commit but there was only 1-2 lines of changes.

## Week of December 16-19

- StackOverflow reading, not much changes to actual project.
- Tons of issues with the actual project here since I decided to start using JS which is why I had so many errors. I couldn't figure out anything and it took a while to read through the articles to understand async puppeteer stuff, Node.JS basics, etc. Very steep learning curve, most of my time was just reading articles so I did basically zero actual coding. 
- Some side projects, like solving a few CCC problems. 

## Days of December 11-12

- Reading Puppeteer documentation and watching vids
- Wrote some psuedocode not for the project to test it out, did not make any core changes to the project

## Pre-December 10

- All of the work had been on Python so I did not commit anything and I stored everything locally. I decided pretty early on that it was not worth it to write the backend in Python. I am already really comfortable with it and I was pretty much wrapping up the project, so it wasn't worthy of a major project. I decided to learn Node.JS, considering that I only started learning JS in this class, to make it more of a challenge. Looking back, this could have been a miscalculation since I got a bunch of random errors that I spent most of my time fixing and I could have probably done a lot more in just Python. But, I still say it's worth it to learn.
