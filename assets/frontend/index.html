    <div class="indentdiv">

        <p class = "introduction">Dihydrogen monoxide (Chemical Symbol H20) is a deadly chemical 
            that is responsible for countless deaths and diseases around the world. 
            It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless liquid that can cause severe burns, 
            suffocation, drowning, and dehydration. It is also a major component of acid rain, 
            greenhouse gases, and nuclear weapons. It is found in almost every natural and artificial environment, 
            from oceans and rivers to clouds and pipes. It is used in many industries, 
            such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, where it contaminates the 
            soil, air, and water with harmful substances. It is also ingested by 
            billions of people every day, who are unaware of its toxic effects on their health.
